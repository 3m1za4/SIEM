### Review EVTX Files
- What is the size of the event log file? Is it at least as large as policy requires?
- What is the oldest event recorded? Is it at least as old as policy requires?
- Which Event IDs can be filtered out, having no value to the investigation?
- Hopefully you can come to investigate the event log with some key times/activities in mind to act as threads to pull. Focus on those areas of the timeline and spread out.
- Filter according to [Notable-Event-IDs](Notable-Event-IDs.md)
