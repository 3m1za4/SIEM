Signatures should be mapped to use cases based on grouping that makes sense. This mapping allows the investigator to review recommended response actions. A good start would be using MITRE ATT&CK framework Tactics as Use Cases for signatures.

These less-technical use cases should also be considered for addition into your use case library: 
- The mouse and/or keyboard start moving/typing on their own.
- A device performs unexpected functions on its own (like a gate opening or closing unexpectedly).
- An endpoint computer fails to boot up properly.
- A ransomware message is displayed.
- A caller claims to be the helpdesk or other member of IT Staff.
- An unidentified peripheral (like a USB) is found connected to a system.
- An email or document suggests calling a provided phone number for support (e.g. Microsoft).
- Historic events are seemingly deleted or otherwise no longer available.
- Unauthorized changes appear to have been made to a device's logic code/configuration.
- A secure location shows clear signs of breaking and entering.
- An unauthorized person is found in a location.
