General guidance for writing technical documentation (procedures, especially).
 
- Use "Navigate to **X** > **Y** > **Z**" to describe going through a menu system. Bold each level of navigation.
- Use "Select **X**" to describe a menu dropdown. Bold the selection name.
- Use "Click the **X** Button" to describe clicking buttons. Bold the button text.
- Use "Click the **X** Radio Button" to describe selecting radio buttons. Bold the selected radio button text.
- Use "In **X** Type _Y_" for supplying text to a text field. Bold the text field name, _italicize_ the text to be provided.
- Use "Check **X**" to describe adding a checkmark. Bold the checkmark text.
- Avoid numbering images and steps, if possible. These are only needed if heavy back/forward references are needed.
- Avoid overuse of images/screenshots. They should only be used to clarify situations/steps that are inherently more difficult and an image provides clarity for.
